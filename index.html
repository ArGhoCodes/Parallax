        <h2>What is parallax scrolling?</h2>
        <p>
            Parallax scrolling is a computer graphics technique used by web designers to create a faux-3D effect.
            As users scroll down a webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds move at different speeds, and this creates an optical illusion.
            Using parallax scrolling is not a new technique. In the early 1980s, game designers working on Super Mario Bros. used parallax graphics to create a sensation of depth. 

            Today, parallax scrolling has become more of a trend in the web design world—and for good reason. Scrolling is easier than clicking, and a well-designed parallax effect engages users to scroll for more information.

        <h2>Why should I use parallax graphics?</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><h3>It helps to tell a story and improves User Engagement </h3></li>
          </ul>
          Parallax graphics are ideal for storytelling.
           Good design is all about communication—and when we design websites, we want to communicate with our visitors and tell a compelling story about our product, service, or brand.
            Parallax scrolling allows us to immerse our website visitors in unique online experiences.
            A well-crafted parallax page gives the user the type of dynamic experience that tends to keep them on the page longer.
